Contributing to x3d2
====================

Fixed a bug?  Have an idea for improving x3d2? x3d2 is developed in
the open with a license that allows anyone to:

- Run the program as they wish, for any purpose.
- Access and study its source code, and making changes to it.
- Redistribute copies (source or binary).
- Distribute copies of your modified versions (source or binary).

Particularly, we encourage developers to contribute their changes back
to the x3d2 project. The following sections describe the process for
doing so.

If you are looking to take part in the project but don't have anything
specific in mind, you could consider:

- Reporting (a) bug(s), suggest improvement(s) or share a user experience.
- Adding documentation or improving the current one.
- Working on fixing issues or implementing new features.

In any of the cases above, your entry point should be the `issue
tracker <https://github.com/xcompact3d/x3d2/issues>`_ -- either to
pick an existing issue to work on or to create a new one.
