     !! User code can request access to a memory block by using the

     !! returned and the block is detached from the list.  If the list

     !! In order to reuse memory it is important that user code
     !! release blocks when they are not needed anymore.  This is done
     !! by calling the type bound procedure
     !! [[m_allocator(module):release_block(subroutine)]].  The
     !! released block is then pushed in front of the block list.
